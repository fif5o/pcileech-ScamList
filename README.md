Some Chinese Scammer set up fake-members discord for selling plastic firmware

# The Beater Server

By creating a fake discord server and adding a large number of fake-bots, they made them a "official" firmware author, and wanted to sell their multiplayer firmware on the server like kilmu.They cheat trust by buying a large number of fake Github Stars/Forks.And they bought github robots to regularly update some overflowing firmware basic tutorials, and then profited from them. If you know some FPGA or have read some basic tutorials, you will not be fooled by it.

他们通过创建一个假的Discord服务器并添加大量虚假成员，他们使他们成为“官方”固件作者，并想像kilmu一样在服务器上出售他们的劣质游戏固件。他们通过购买大量虚假的Github Stars/Forks来欺骗信任。并且他们购买了github机器人来定时更新一些泛滥的firmware基础教程，然后从中获利。如果你是懂一些FPGA的人或看过一些基础教程的人，你不会因此上当。
